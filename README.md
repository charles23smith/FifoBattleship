# FifoBattleship
Battleship game for two computers using SSH connection and fifos for communication. 
This uses a Server-Client model, where player1.cpp is the server and player2.cpp is the client. Therefore player1.cpp needs to be ran first and then player2.cpp from the connected client computer. 

Code is in the master branch.
